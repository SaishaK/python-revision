#Rakshita wants to calculate her age. So she subtracted her year of birth from the current year. Her classmates also wanted to find their age in the same way. So she decides to write a python program where students can input their year of birth, then the program will print their age. Write the same program to find your age and help your classmates in finding their age.

year = int(input("Enter you year of birth"))
current_year = 2022

age = current_year - year
print(age)
